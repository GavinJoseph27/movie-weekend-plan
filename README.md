## How It Works

- MongoDB stores all application data (users, services, orders)
- User authentication is handled using sessions
- Middleware enforces login and admin authorization
- Orders are linked to the logged-in user for history tracking
- Statistics are calculated server-side from MongoDB data
- Streaming services are initialized from JSON seed files
- Order form logic runs client-side with server validation
- Navigation updates dynamically based on user login state

## Authentication
